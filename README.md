## **Wine Quality Prediction using MLP Classifier**

This project utilizes a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier** to classify wine quality based on various chemical properties. The model was trained and evaluated on the **Wine Quality dataset**, achieving promising accuracy.

## **Features of the Dataset:**
The model classifies the category of wine based on the following properties:
- **Alcohol**
- **Malic acid**
- **Ash**
- **Alcalinity of ash**
- **Magnesium**
- **Total phenols**
- **Flavanoids**
- **Nonflavanoid phenols**
- **Proanthocyanins**
- **Color intensity**
- **Hue**
- **OD280/OD315 of diluted wines**
- **Proline**

## **Key Features:**
- **Model Training**: Implemented an **MLP Classifier** for effective classification.
- **Weights and Biases Extraction**: Pulled out the weights and biases from the trained model for further analysis and visualization.
- **Dataset**: Utilized the **Wine Quality dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Feel free to explore the code and insights derived from the model!
